These scripts will build both libvpx and the libvpx-tester.

Place the main build script and "script" directory into the directory you wish to build from.
Then run the main build script.

For example to build the tester for Visual Studios 9 go to the Win directory then VS9 then copy
libvpx-full-build-win-vs and the folder named "scripts" to the directory you wish to build in.

Then run ./libvpx-full-build-win-vs in a bash enviornment.
